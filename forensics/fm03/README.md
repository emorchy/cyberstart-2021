The name of the extracted file ("dir_volume") was unhelpful in my forensic analysis, and I gave up on this challenge and moved to other ones. Not much later, CyberStart released a hint to this challenge, as not one person has solved it yet. The hint was that the volume was an encrypted veracrypt drive. Bingo.

[Hashcat](https://hashcat.net/wiki/), an amazing password cracker, actually supports multiple veracrypt volumes:

```

Those are a lot of options! Which one do we choose?

Thankfully, the "Y" option has a number "3" that can test all the Y options, preventing constant adjustments and headaches. I decided to go in order of the X values with a small password list.

```
$ hashcat -m 13723 --force dir_volume 1000-most-common-passwords.txt
--snip--
dir_volume:redwings                              
                                                 
Session..........: hashcat
Status...........: Cracked
--snip--
```

After two tries, the hashing algorithm turned out to be PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512, with the password "redwings". All that is left is to decrypt with veracrypt.

The volume contains a simple folder titled "Flag" and a file named "flag.txt", with the contents being: `Us3_5tr0ng_P@55w0Rds!`
